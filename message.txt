fixed cheat code, duplicate fighters' names

the way the flow of initializing the game goes made me create a fighter when
using cheat to avoid null pointer exceptions

because you won't be able to switch to the other duplicate fighter using linear
search

 - more accuracy in battle view during battle
 - updated create new fighter view
 - updated upgrade fighter view
